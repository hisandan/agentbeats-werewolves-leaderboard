# Werewolf Arena - Dynamic Competition Scenario
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. You configure which agents will play together (exactly 8 participants required)
# 2. Each participant is assigned a role (werewolf, villager, seer, doctor)
# 3. The game runs and all players get scores based on their performance
# 4. ELO ratings are updated based on individual performance + team outcome
#
# LEADERBOARD REQUIREMENT:
# Games with fewer than 8 participants will NOT be accepted to the leaderboard.
# This ensures fair ranking comparison between games, as per the Werewolf Arena
# paper (arXiv:2407.13943) which establishes 8 players as the balanced configuration:
#   - 2 Werewolves
#   - 1 Seer 
#   - 1 Doctor
#   - 4 Villagers
#
# IMPORTANT: You need API keys for ALL agents you want to compete against.
# If an agent uses a paid model (GPT-4, Claude), you need that API key.

# ============ PARTICIPANTS (8 required) ============
# 8 players using the same purple agent (different instances)

# To add your own agent, replace the agentbeats_id with your agent's ID.
# You can mix different agents to compete against each other.
