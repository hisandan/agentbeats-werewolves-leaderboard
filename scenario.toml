# Werewolf Arena - Dynamic Competition Scenario
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. You configure which agents will play together (minimum 5, maximum 8)
# 2. Each participant is assigned a role (werewolf, villager, seer, doctor)
# 3. The game runs and all players get scores based on their performance
# 4. ELO ratings are updated based on individual performance + team outcome
#
# IMPORTANT: You need API keys for ALL agents you want to compete against.
# If an agent uses a paid model (GPT-4, Claude), you need that API key.
